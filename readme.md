App Academy Final Project - Trello Clone / Planning and Collaboration App
---

### Overview

Early Worm is a Trello-like garden planning and collaboration app, featuring a drag-and-drop user interface, asynchronous page updates, photo uploads via Paperclip and storage with Amazon AWS.

### Gems, Libraries & Technologies

*  Underscore.js, JQuery
*  Figaro - passwords and credentials 
*  Paperclip & Amazon AWS - photo uploads and storage
*  Addressable 


### Goals

Early Worm was my final project for App Academy, and presented a great opportunity to put everything we learned about the full stack to use by building an app from start to finish.


### Getting Started

Just click "Sign In" to enter Demo Mode. Here you can play around with most of the app's features.

From the first page, you can see all of your "Garden" projects, all of the "Cards" you've created, and any notifications you might have.

* Click on "Worcester St Community Garden" to check out your main project page. Here you have "lists" of related items, and "cards" for specific notes or projects. Here you can see a quick overview of topics, due dates, numbers of comments, and colored "flags"

* From here, you can drag notes around to different lists, or put lists in different positions - your changes will be saved even if you refresh the page.

* You'll see notifications if you have any upcoming events within the next 3 days. 

* If you click on a note, you can see more detailed information. You can toggle flags (they'll update both in the card view and the main list view). You can check out the comments other people made, or post your own. You can assign the card a due date, or upload a photo.
